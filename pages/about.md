Welcome!

This is a blog about embedded systems development for which the [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) language plays a central role. We include here:

- Haskell code compiled for embedded CPUs,
- Haskell EDSLs and libraries for code generation to an embedded platform (e.g. [Ivory][], [Copilot][], [SBV][], or even [llvm-general][] depending on usage),
- Haskell EDSLs for design, synthesis, and verification of circuits (e.g. [CλaSH][], or the [Lava][] family of systems),
- DSLs that are Haskell-inspired and Haskell-hosted, targeting various embedded systems (e.g. [Reduceron][] for FPGAs or ASICs, [Idris][] for C, [Cryptol][] for either),

# Site Details
This site is itself written in Haskell via the [Hakyll][] library. You may find all of its source code at its [GitHub repository][github].

# Member Biographies
You can find members of the Haskell Embedded group on the [GitHub Organization][github-org] or in the IRC channel [#haskell-embedded][haskellembedded-irc] on [Freenode][].

## [Calvin Beck](https://github.com/Chobbes)
I enjoy long walks on the beach, lukewarm coffee, and candle-making.

## [Chris Hodapp](https://github.com/Hodapp87)
I stumbled into Haskell around 2013. Well, more accurately, I had been stumbling into Haskell long before this, but in 2013 I stumbled into Haskell and for the first time did not just dust myself off and keep walking.

My undergraduate degree is electrical engineering (from University of Cincinnati in 2010). I worked at Valco Cincinnati through the co-op program that my degree required, and this introduced me to embedded design. This continued through being a founding member of the [Hive13](http://www.hive13.org/) hackerspace. Some professors at UC tried to steer me toward type theory and functional programming, but mostly I tried very hard to ignore them.

My brother saw me trying to hack up a DOS batch file to play tic-tac-toe, and showed me how to program in BASIC. I forgave him later for this. I learned [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) in 2003 when I had a science fair project due the next week and very quickly realized that BASIC on MS-DOS was simply not going to handle a 40 MB dataset. This means that I can say completely un-ironically that I used Ruby before it was cool. It also led to me becoming an object-oriented programming snob. For reasons I really don't remember, I learned Python 6 months later and have kept using it.

I forget why I wrote the above because it has nothing to do with Haskell or embedded programming.

Since 2004, my preferred tool stack was a combination of Python for anything high-level and C for anything lower-level.

I hate long walks on the beach. Actually, I have a passionate hatred for beaches in general. The sand always get into my laptop and this interferes with my Haskell time.
