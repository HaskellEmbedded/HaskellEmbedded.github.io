title: How I Got Here (i.e. to using Haskell for embedded code)
author: Chris Hodapp
---

Rough outline:
- How I stumbled into using Haskell
- What my experiences were prior to this
- My results with Ivory
- More specific Ivory examples?  (Or save those for a later post?)  I could probably create a simplified example.
- Atom & concurrency
- "Some background: My undergrad degree is EE. Since 2004, my preferred tool stack was a combination of Python for anything high-level and C for anything lower-level." - Put this elsewhere?
- What about the Ruby quote that I quite like?
