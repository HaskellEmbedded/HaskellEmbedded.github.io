title: How I Got Here (i.e. to using Haskell for embedded code)
author: Chris Hodapp
---

Some ideas:

- What my experiences were prior to this
- My results with Ivory
- More specific Ivory examples?  I could probably create a simplified example.
- Atom & concurrency - some examples here would be most helpful.
- What about the Ruby creator quote that I quite like?
- For Ivory: What I ran into with C forcing a coupling between compilation unit and local representation.

Stuff that might be out of the scope of this blog:

- Why did I like Ruby?
- Why did I like Python?
- What did I find interesting about Lisp?

Big Gaping Holes in This Example
====
Things I still have not touched:

1. Phases (in any useful sense)
2. Probes
3. Assertions
4. Coverage checking
5. What the Atom compiler outputs
6. What generated code looks like
7. Periods overriding later periods
8. The practical notion that you can apply periods and phases to entire sub-rules if you like
