title: How I Got Here (i.e. to using Haskell for embedded code)
author: Chris Hodapp

Some ideas:

- What my experiences were prior to this
- My results with Ivory
- More specific Ivory examples?  I could probably create a simplified example.
- Atom & concurrency - some examples here would be most helpful.
- What about the Ruby creator quote that I quite like?

Stuff that might be out of the scope of this blog:

- Why did I like Ruby?
- Why did I like Python?
- What did I find interesting about Lisp?
