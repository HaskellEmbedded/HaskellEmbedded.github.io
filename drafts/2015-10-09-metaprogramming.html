<p>My <a href="../posts/2015-06-09-atom-cincyfp-slides.md">last post</a> mentioned that some things need some better explanation, because I’m always trying to re-explain and clarify.</p>
<p>This blog is devoted to the use of Haskell with embedded systems. What does that even mean? We interpret it in a pretty open-ended way. Particularly, we see a couple broad categories (which the slides on the last page, as well as our <a href="../pages/links.html">Links</a> page, mirror):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Full Compilation:</em> Compiling Haskell code to an embedded target.</li>
<li><em>Limited Compilation:</em> Compiling some limited subset of Haskell code to an embedded target.</li>
<li><em>Compiled EDSL:</em> Hosting in Haskell an EDSL and a compiler to an embedded target.</li>
</ol>
<p>As far as I know, I made these categories up. If anyone happens to know a more established classification, or anyone who wrote about it first, please tell me.</p>
<p>The distinction between these isn’t rigorous (and I’ll explain that later where I can). The commonality is that in all cases one uses Haskell to express something (a program, a circuit, specifications, call it what you will) for an embedded target.</p>
<p>I exclude things like Cryptol and Idris from this because - while implemented in Haskell and used for embedded platforms - they are different languages unto themselves. We might arbitrarily drop that distinction in the future if we feel like it.</p>
<h1 id="full-compilation">Full Compilation</h1>
<p>This compiles Haskell code to run directly on an embedded target. The <a href="../pages/links.html#compiling-to-embedded-targets">Compiling to Embedded Targets</a> section of the Links page is concerned particularly with this.</p>
<p>The nature of the Haskell language brings some challenges. Particularly, one must make the Haskell runtime fit on the target and make the garbage collection behave sanely.</p>
<p>Ajhc (<a href="https://github.com/ajhc/ajhc" class="uri">https://github.com/ajhc/ajhc</a>), a JHC-derived compiler from Kiwamu Okabe of METASEPI, is the only example of this I found - it could compile and execute on ARM Cortex-M3/M4. Kiwamu seems to have written a lot on his experiences with making Haskell run in this footprint. His subsequent switch to the ATS language may be a hint.</p>
<h1 id="limited-compilation">Limited Compilation</h1>
<p>This uses an existing compiler for certain stages (such as the parsing and type-checking), but a custom back-end to actually produce code, often with a lot of static analysis. This may adapt or disallow certain constructs (for instance, floating-point, recursive functions, recursive datatypes: <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/clash-prelude-0.10/docs/CLaSH-Tutorial.html#unsupported">CλaSH Unsupported Haskell features</a>).</p>
<p>GHC accomodates this by allowing developers to invoke GHC functionality, from Haskell, <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/As_a_library">as a library</a>. ([ghcjs][https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs] uses this, as far as I know.)</p>
<p>The <a href="../pages/links.html#compiling-for-fpgaasic">Compiling for FPGA/ASIC</a> section of the Links page has a few examples of this.</p>
<h1 id="compiled-edsl">Compiled EDSL</h1>
<p>The <a href="../pages/links.html#code-generation-edsls">Code Generation EDSLs</a> and <a href="../pages/links.html#circuit-design-edsls">Circuit Design EDSLs</a> sections of the Links page cover the copious examples of this. Atom, the topic of a few of my prior posts, is in this category.</p>
<p>This category is the one I am most often having to explain. It uses an EDSL (embedded domain-specific language) inside of Haskell to direct the process of code generation to a lower-level representation. (Otherwise called: <em>compiling</em>.)</p>
<p>Note that in this case, Haskell code never actually <em>runs</em> on the embedded target. Rather, it uses specifications in the EDSL to build a representation of what <em>will</em> run there - in other words, a sort of metaprogramming, using Haskell as a template language or macro language.</p>
<p>To emphasize: The code that runs on the target is entirely decoupled from the Haskell runtime. The Haskell compiler here isn’t compiling anything for the target - it’s compiling another compiler.</p>
<p>This is a limitation of one sort:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basically all notions of ‘runtime’ on the embedded target must be handled separately. (Ivory works with this still, for instance with the Num typeclass, in some surprising ways. More on that will follow in a future post!)</li>
<li>This adds the confusion and complication of another stage (possibly more) to the process of bringing code/specifications to the embedded target.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s also a benefit of another sort:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any Haskell environment compatible with the libraries in question should produce the same results (as far as the embedded target cares).</li>
<li>That stage separation also adds a nice opportunity for static analysis and optimization. (For instance, Copilot makes use of this to add an interpreter/simulator, SBV uses it to prove or disprove given properties about the code, and Atom uses it to verify some timing constraints.)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="commonality">Commonality</h1>
<p>Lumping together these categories might seem like a stretch, especially considering that the last category involves extra stages and a shift in how one thinks about the software.</p>
<p>Ponder the following, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>A “normal” Haskell program interacts through what is sequenced in the <code>IO</code> monad (particularly, <code>main</code>).</li>
<li>An Atom specification interacts through what is sequenced in the <code>Atom</code> monad (particularly, whichever ones you pass to the Atom compiler).</li>
<li>An Ivory program interacts through what is sequenced in the <code>Ivory</code> monad (particularly, whichever ones you pass to the Ivory compiler).</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.clash-lang.org/">CλaSH</a> description interacts through the <code>Signal</code> applicative (particularly, <code>topEntity</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The trend should be clear: Spanning our three categories, Haskell can be used in roughly the same way in each. Ignoring the hand-waviness of “declarative”, in all cases Haskell expresses something declaratively, and the only difference is whether the Haskell compiler and runtime handles it, or whether some other compiler does.</p>
