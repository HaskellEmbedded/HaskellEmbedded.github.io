*Later note: This post is back-dated because while I'd put the slides
 in the repository already, I had not actually linked to them or said
 anything about them.*

The fine people at [CincyFP](https://cincyfp.wordpress.com/), the
local functional programming group, requested that I give a
presentation on some of the embedded Haskell stuff I was doing, and I
did this at the [June meeting][cincyfp-announcement].

I put the slides from the presentation up [here][slides-local] (and
[Markdown source][slides-markdown-local]; or look
[in the repo][slides-repo]).  CincyFP has a lot of Clojure
aficionados, so in terms of Haskell-heavy details I kept this
presentation as a "part 1" to some possible future presentations.
(Actually, not even that, since the title was "EDSLs &
Metaprogramming" and I barely scratched the surface of that.)

- Things I keep having to explain over and over
- Extended explanation of certain slides
- Link to example code (it's in the repo)
