<h1 id="ion-to-do">Ion to-do</h1>
<p>Ion post to-do list - I’d like Ion to be on Hackage. Does Ion require latest Ivory, or does the Hackage version work fine? If Hackage version is fine, then I need not touch Ivory. If newer is needed, then perhaps I should get Ivory into NixOS. - How do I get a nix specification into ‘official’ channels? - It might be good to get both Ion and Ivory into NixOS.</p>
<h1 id="ivory-thoughts">Ivory thoughts</h1>
<p>What would I aim to change in Ivory? - Separate procedure’s interface and implementation. - Make a cleaner way to get at multiple representations of the same thing. For instance: 16-bit integer == 2 x uint8_t == uint8_t* - Clean up some of the type trickery any way possible! It wants to be replaced with dependent types. - Compatibility outside of GHC? - Remove all the half-assed, ill-explained kludges.</p>
<p>I don’t foresee maintenance happening on it, or further development, unless I do it myself or push hard for it.</p>
<p>My realistic options: - Re-implement more cleanly in Haskell. - Re-implement more cleanly in something with dependent types, like Idris. - Fork it and fix it in ways that may not be palatable to the maintainers - and maintain it myself (or with HaskellEmbedded).</p>
<p>My complaint is all the unfinished code there that no one who understands has made a priority to finish or support, including the original authors.</p>
<p>My aim is that the package itself, or something implementing similar functionality, be organized and compatible enough that it may survive in the future in a useful form.</p>
<h1 id="unsolved-ivory-gripes">Unsolved Ivory gripes</h1>
<p>I keep running into things that are a bit crucial for most “real” systems programming when interfacing with existing APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking at <a href="https://github.com/GaloisInc/ivory/issues/6" class="uri">https://github.com/GaloisInc/ivory/issues/6</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GaloisInc/ivory/issues/62" class="uri">https://github.com/GaloisInc/ivory/issues/62</a>, it is still impossible to make an opaque type of arbitrary name - in the C sense of a type which can be instantiated and which can appear in function signatures, but which cannot (or should not) be inspected or used in any other way.</li>
<li>An opaque type can be made if it happens to have <code>struct</code> in the name via <code>abstract struct</code> in Ivory’s quasiquoter.</li>
<li>Ivory’s <code>OpaqueType</code> is much more restrictive. It has no associated type name, and it can neither be instantiated nor can it appear in a function’s signature. It can only refer to an externally-defined variable and only for the sake of passing it to an externally-defined function.</li>
<li>I’m still not sure how to properly render a C <code>enum</code>.</li>
<li>The split between structs and BitData is a bit jarring and annoying.</li>
<li>This feels less like an Ivory issue and more of an issue that’s just inherent to trying to make C code more formal in its behavior, but some of the behavior around pointers can be tedious.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="ideas">Ideas</h1>
<p>Some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>What my experiences were prior to this</li>
<li>My results with Ivory</li>
<li>More specific Ivory examples? I could probably create a simplified example.</li>
<li>Atom &amp; concurrency - some examples here would be most helpful.</li>
<li>What about the Ruby creator quote that I quite like?</li>
<li>For Ivory: What I ran into with C forcing a coupling between compilation unit and local representation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stuff that might be out of the scope of this blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did I like Ruby?</li>
<li>Why did I like Python?</li>
<li>What did I find interesting about Lisp?</li>
</ul>

<p>Things I still have not touched:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Phases (in any useful sense)</li>
<li>Probes</li>
<li>Assertions</li>
<li>Coverage checking</li>
<li>What the Atom compiler outputs</li>
<li>What generated code looks like</li>
<li>Periods overriding later periods</li>
<li>The practical notion that you can apply periods and phases to entire sub-rules if you like</li>

<h1 id="copilot-scraps">Copilot scraps</h1>
<p>TODO below: - Links to Copilot calls - Functional Roboticist slides</p>
<p>Copilot and Atom share some similarities (besides the fact that Copilot can use Atom for code generation). Both are synchronous, realtime languages.</p>
<p>As some of the posts on Atom say, Atom’s basic unit is a <em>rule</em> which involves some atomic operation. That rule might have restrictions such as being active only at certain clock ticks or under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Copilot’s basic unit is a <em>stream</em>. Streams have a value at every clock tick. That value might come from some built-in streams (such as constant values or clocks), from sampling an external variable or function, or from operations on existing streams (such as adding, logical AND, or referring to past values). <em>Triggers</em> are the mechanism for calling anything external.</p>
<p>Copilot also has some decent papers written about it, and it has two very helpful features that are not present in Atom: pretty-printing the specification (‘prettyPrint’), and interpreting the specification (‘interpret’) for a given number of cycles.</p>
<h1 id="abstract-scraps">Abstract scraps</h1>
<p>I should explore more the notion of ‘lifting’ a lower-level language up into Haskell, enabling Haskell as a template, macro, or metaprogramming language. (I’m not sure which term fits best there.)</p>
<p>The paper <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/nick/coqasm.pdf">Coq: The world’s best macro assembler?</a> uses both ‘metaprogramming’ and ‘macro’ to refer to this. However, the terms may differ based on the level of the language. Ivory, for instance, lifts a representation of the C language up into Haskell, and it generates C. Atom generates C, but what it provides in Haskell is a representation of a more constrained abstraction, so it is not simply a matter of saying that it lifts the lower-level language up to the level of Haskell.</p>
<h1 id="ivory-scraps">Ivory scraps</h1>
<p>One thing I see is that Ivory has embedded a “dumber” type system into Haskell’s. Some types have a runtime meaning in Haskell, and those have a runtime meaning in C in certain cases. Those cases include most numeric values, some lists of the same, and strings.</p>
<p>It doesn’t include functions, tuples, anything polymorphic, algebraic data types, records, and really any inductive type (except numeric lists).</p>
<p>But, some types with a runtime meaning in Haskell also have a compile-time meaning in C. That is, C code is a first-class value, as are C functions, and, to an extent, C files/modules.</p>
<p>Is the confusion/clumsiness because of the similarities to Haskell that are limited?</p>
