- Firmata post!

# Chobbes
- Post on Hipster, your MIPSy EDSL thingy!

# Hodapp
- An introduction/release of Ion (badly overdue).
- Integrating Ivory and Shake (I really should try out
[shake-language-c][]).
- Bluetooth Low Energy services & characteristics, and how much Ivory
helped here with the code generation?  (How feasible is this, without
a 'real' API to target?  I suppose I could just target Nordic nRF.)
- Simpler Ivory code-generation examples.
- An example that uses ekmett's linear algebra libraries with Ivory
(link to a PDF of the Galois paper that explains why this is
possible).

# Anyone
- Compatibility tests of some libraries with other Haskell
implementations (JHC/Ajhc? UHC? Hugs? Frege?)
- Arduino examples with Ivory?
