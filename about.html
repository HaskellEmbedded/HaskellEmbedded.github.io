            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>Welcome!</p>
<p>This is a blog about embedded systems programming using the Haskell programming language.</p>

<p>I enjoy long walks on the beach, lukewarm coffee, and candle-making.</p>

<p>I stumbled into Haskell around 2013. Well, more accurately, I had been stumbling into Haskell long before this, but in 2013 I stumbled into Haskell and for the first time did not just dust myself off and keep walking.</p>
<p>My undergraduate degree is electrical engineering (from University of Cincinnati in 2010). I worked at Valco Cincinnati through the co-op program that my degree required, and this introduced me to embedded design. This continued through being a founding member of the <a href="http://www.hive13.org/">Hive13</a> hackerspace. Some professors at UC tried to steer me toward type theory and functional programming, but mostly I tried very hard to ignore them.</p>
<p>My brother saw me trying to hack up a DOS batch file to play tic-tac-toe, and showed me how to program in BASIC. I forgave him later for this. I learned <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> in 2003 when I had a science fair project due the next week and very quickly realized that BASIC on MS-DOS was simply not going to handle a 40 MB dataset. This means that I can say completely un-ironically that I used Ruby before it was cool. It also led to me becoming an object-oriented programming snob. For reasons I really donâ€™t remember, I learned Python 6 months later and have kept using it.</p>
<p>I forget why I wrote the above because it has nothing to do with Haskell or embedded programming.</p>
<p>Since 2004, my preferred tool stack was a combination of Python for anything high-level and C for anything lower-level.</p>

<p>I hate long walks on the beach. Actually, I have a passionate hatred for beaches in general. The sand always get into my laptop and this interferes with my Haskell time.</p>
