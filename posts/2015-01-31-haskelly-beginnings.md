Greetings, all!

This is the start of a project to expand Haskell's reach in the embedded world. At the moment we are simply exploring some of the available options, and we hope to expand on the documentation, and examples that are available. Here's a list of some of the things which we are aware of? Got anymore? Let us know!

- [Copilot](http://leepike.github.io/Copilot/)
- [Atom](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/atom)
- [Ivory](http://ivorylang.org/ivory-introduction.html)

We'll have a better idea of what's going on with this soon. Right now this is essentially just a test of our super cool [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) blog using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

You can find the source for this blog [here](https://github.com/HaskellEmbedded/HaskellEmbedded.github.io/tree/source)!
